0.0.2	* removed Lucene KpStemmer, because the lucene stemmer classes conflicted with the 
	      Edison dependency 'snowball-1.0', which has the exact same path name. This led to 
	      subclasses of each failing to find their parent class's protected methods. 
	    * removed compile-time dependency on IllinoisPreprocessor, because otherwise, can't 
	      incorporate it into the IllinoisPreprocessor. This makes testing difficult, as tests
	      require Record objects to be created. Pro tem, rely on tests in IllinoisPreprocessor
	      and of Curator Lemmatizer component. 
	    * moved LemmatizerTest out of src/test/java to the main package to preserve it for
	      later modification 
	      
0.0.3--
0.0.5   * added tests using serialized records, fixing problem referred to for 0.0.2
          above
        * updated dependencies, using curator-utils to provide serialized record handling

0.0.6--
0.0.7   * fixed a bug (unexplained) where the JWNL library did not resolve common plural forms
          like "dogs" (though it did resolve others), using solution provided by John Wieting
          (uses MIT's WordNet API for that case)).
          
0.0.8   * updated documentation as standalone package (i.e., when using other than as a curator
          component)
